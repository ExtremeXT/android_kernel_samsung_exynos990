## Build instructions:

1. Set up build environment as per Google documentation

https://source.android.com/docs/setup/start/requirements

* The `libarchive-tools` package is also necessary to patch the toolchain.
* The `ccache` package is necessary if you wish to build with CCache (Quicker subsequest builds)

2. Properly clone repository with submodules (KernelSU and toolchains)

```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ExtremeXT/android_kernel_samsung_exynos990.git```

3. Build for your device without CCache and with KSU

```./build.sh -m x1slte -k y -c n```

4. Fetch the flashable zip of the kernel that was just compiled

```build/out/[your_device]/ExtremeKernel...zip```

5. Flash it using a supported recovery like TWRP or PBRP (AOSP recovery does not work)

6. Enjoy!
